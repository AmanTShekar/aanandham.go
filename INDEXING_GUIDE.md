# How to Get Your Site Indexed by Google

Since I have already optimized your technical SEO (Sitemap, Robots.txt, Meta Tags, Schema), the final step is to **signal Google** to crawl your site.

## Step 1: Google Search Console (Crucial)

1.  **Go to** [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console).
2.  **Add Property**: Enter `https://aanandham.in`.
3.  **Verify Ownership**: 
    *   If you haven't verified yet, Google will ask you to add a DNS record or an HTML tag.
    *   *Note*: Your `index.html` already contains a verification tag (`JGDIH...`). If this matches your account, you just need to click "Verify".
4.  **Submit Sitemap**:
    *   Go to **Sitemaps** in the sidebar.
    *   Enter `sitemap.xml` and click **Submit**.
    *   You should see a "Success" status. This tells Google exactly which pages to index (including your new blogs).

## Step 2: Request Indexing (Optional but Faster)

1.  In Search Console, paste your URL (`https://aanandham.in`) into the top search bar.
2.  Click **Request Indexing**.
3.  Repeat this for your main pages like `https://aanandham.in/hotels` if you want them prioritized.

## Step 3: Social Signals

*   Share your new blog links (e.g., `https://aanandham.in/stories/munnar-camping-guide`) on Twitter, WhatsApp, or Facebook. External links help Google find your site faster.
